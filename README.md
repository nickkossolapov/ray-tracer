## Setup (mingw)

1. Download latest [SDL 3.2 release](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases)
2. Copy contents in `\x86_64-w64-mingw32` to `D:/libaries/SDL3` (or adjust path in [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt))
3. Add `D:\libraries\SDL3\bin` to environment variables

## Build

Currently built using MinGW and CMake included in CLion.
I should probably get around to building and running this with the CLI.
